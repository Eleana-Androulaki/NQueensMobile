# NQueensMobile
The classic problem of N queens, originally published by Max Bezzel in 1848, is defined like this:
Place N queens in a NxN chessboard so that no queen threatens any other.
          As you already may know, a queen threatens another chess piece if they share the same row, column or diagonal.
          This game is a slight alteration of the N-queens problem:
          In a NxN chessboard we need to place M queens ( M less than or equal to N)
          so that no queen threatens another and additionally,
          all chessboard tiles are threatened by at least one queen.
